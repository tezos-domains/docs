# Auction Operations

### Contract: TLDRegistrar.Bid

Places a new highest bid on a domain that is currently [in auction](../design-document/top-level-domain-registrar.md#open-auction). The bid will record the indicated amount and the sender as the new highest bidder. The bid amount has to be higher than `round_to_nearest_tenth(previous_highest_bid * (100 + min_bid_increase_ratio) / 100)`.

Additionally:

* If there is a previous highest bid, it is replaced and its amount is credited to the previous highest bidder. 
* If the current auction end is lower than `NOW + bid_additional_period`, it is updated to `NOW + bid_additional_period`.

Entrypoint: `bid`

The amount sent in this transaction plus the in-contract balance of the sender has to be higher or equal to the bid amount.
