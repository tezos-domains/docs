# .tez TLD

Currently, the only supported top-level domain is `.tez`. On Delphinet, it's been renamed to `.delphi` to avoid potential confusion between Delphinet and Mainnet. You can find the corresponding TLDRegistrar addresses in the [Deployed Contracts]() section.

### Label Validation for .tez \(and .delphi\)

In addition to the rules specified in [Name Validation and Normalization](name-resolution.md#name-validation-and-normalization), the top-level domain requires all labels to only contain the Latin characters `a-z`, `0-9`, and hyphens \(`-`\). Hyphens cannot appear as the first or the last character.
