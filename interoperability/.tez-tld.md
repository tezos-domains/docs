# .tez TLD

Currently, the only supported top-level domain is `.tez`. You can find the corresponding TLDRegistrar addresses in the [Deployed Contracts](../deployed-contracts/carthagenet.md) section.

### Label Validation for .tez 

In addition to the rules specified in [Name Validation and Normalization](name-resolution.md#name-validation-and-normalization), the `.tez` top-level domain requires all labels to only contain the Latin characters `a-z`, `0-9`, and hyphens \(`-`\).
