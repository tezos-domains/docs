### Motivation

Using addresses can become an obstacle for the practical use of Tezos as a currency. It’s clear that a string like `tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb` is usable when transferred by a computer program or using the operating system’s clipboard, but it is unwieldy in most other types of communication. It cannot be memorized or even realistically communicated through human speech or visual media.

Building a system where participants are in charge of creating their aliases presents a straightforward solution. If it is the best solution is a bit less clear, but more on that later. People are already used to creating names for their e-mail boxes, Instagram accounts, or their web pages. The topic of this discussion is providing them with this familiar approach inside the Tezos ecosystem.

### What Is Tezos Name Service

The main function is to translate a meaningful and user-friendly alias to a Tezos address and potentially vice versa. This translation should be globally consistent so that all participants on the blockchain see the same address for a given alias.

A parallel that’s often drawn is to the [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System), a familiar and universally adopted system. Admittedly, DNS becomes an obvious inspiration for similar schemes.

> The Domain Name System \(DNS\) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.

An example of an alias in a system inspired by the DNS could be `alice.tez`. Alice bought it from the central registrar managing `tez` and then assigned it the address of her personal wallet. When she sends money to Bob, he will see `alice.tez` in his wallet’s received transactions, because Alice has also set up a reverse record mapping her address back to `alice.tez`.
