# GraphQL

Our API exposes data in format according to [Relay Connection specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm). This makes it ease to generate client code or do the pagination using cursors in general.

Available entities:

* Domains
* Reverse records
* Purchases - buys and renewals
* Block
